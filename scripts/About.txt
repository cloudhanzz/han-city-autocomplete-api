This shell script is responsible for preparing the geoname entries to be used offline.

1. It downloads http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/allCountries.zip which contains
   over 12 millions places all over the world, unzip it.
   
2. It also downloads http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/admin1CodesASCII.txt which
   contains the state codes and their corresponding state names, and the province codes
   with their corresponding names.

3. The unzipped allCountries.txt file is over 1.5G. It is infeasible to upload this big
   file to GitHub due to the slow upload speed of ordinary home networks and the potential
   limit set by GitHub. For this reason, the script removes all non-US and non-Canada
   entries. To further reduce the file size, this script keeps only the minimal information 
   of each entry, which are the place name, the province (or state) name, the country name,
   the latitude, and the longitude.
   
4. Zip the resulted file to facilicate uploading to GitHub
   
5. It deletes all of the unused files.
